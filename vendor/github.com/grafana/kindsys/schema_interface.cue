// The schema interfaces defined in this file are meta-schemas. They are shared
// contracts between the producers (composable kinds, defined in Grafana
// plugins) and consumers (core and custom Grafana kinds) of composable schemas.
//
// This contract is similar to an interface in most programming languages:
// producer and consumer implementations depend only on the schema interface
// definition, rather than the details of any particular implementation. This
// allows producers and consumers to be loosely coupled, while keeping an
// explicit contract for composition of sub-schemas from producers into the
// consumer schemas that want to use them.
//
// Schema interfaces allow schema composition to be broken down into a series of
// simple "what," "which," and "how" questions:
//
//  - "What" is the subschema to be composed?
//  - "How" should subschema(s) be composed into another schema to produce a unified result schema?
//  - "Which" subset of known composable subschemas ("whats") should be provided in composition ("how")?
//
// On the producer side, Grafana plugin authors may provide Thema lineages
// within Composable kinds declared in .cue files adjacent to their
// plugin.json, following a pattern (see
// github.com/grafana/grafana/pkg/plugins/pfs.GrafanaPlugin.composableKinds)
// corresponding to the name of the schema interface. Each such definition is
// an answer to "what."
//
// On the consumer side, any core or custom kind author can choose to define a
// standard Thema composition slot in its contained lineage that uses one of
// these schema interfaces as its meta-schema. The slot specification in Thema
// answers "how", for that kind.
//
// Composable kinds declared by a plugin are parsed and validated by Grafana's
// plugin system when a plugin is installed. This gives each Grafana instance a
// set of all known Composable kinds ("whats"), which can be narrowed into the
// subsets ("which") that each known Core or Custom can consume. These subsets
// are injected dynamically into the consumers, resulting in the final schema.
//
// For example, in the Thema lineage for the dashboard core kind:
//  - There is a slot named `panelcfg`
//  - It is constrained to accept only Thema lineages following the `panelcfg` schema interface
//  - The composition logic specifies that the `panelcfg.PanelOptions` from each lineage provided
//    to the dashboard lineage be one possibility for `panels[].options`
//
// (TODO actual implementation is pending https://github.com/grafana/thema/issue/8)
//
// Thus, the dashboard schema used for validation by any particular Grafana instance
// can tell the user if a particular dashboard with a `timeseries` panel has invalid
// values for `panels[].options`, even though neither the dashboard core kind, nor the
// the timeseries composable kind, are directly aware of (import) each other.

// A SchemaInterface defines a single Grafana schema interface.

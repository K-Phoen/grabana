// Composable is a category of kind that provides schema elements for
// composition into Core and Custom kinds. Grafana plugins
// provide composable kinds; for example, a datasource plugin provides one to
// describe the structure of its queries, which is then composed into dashboards
// and alerting rules.
//
// Each Composable is an implementation of exactly one Slot, a shared meta-schema
// defined by Grafana itself that constrains the shape of schemas defined in
// that ComposableKind.

	// this Composable kind. The set is open to ensure forward compatibility of
	// Grafana and tooling with any additional schema interfaces that may be added.

	// lineage is the Thema lineage containing all the schemas that have existed for this kind.

//	lineage: { joinSchema: schif.interface }
